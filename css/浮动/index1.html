        Tommy Pham was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2006 MLB Draft and went on to make his major league debut for them in 2014.

        Since then, he has played for several MLB teams, including the Mets, Padres and the Reds, to name a few. He was acquired by the Diamondbacks in the final week of the trade deadline this year, just one day after they had acquired Jace Peterson.
        While Pham may have a slightly notorious reputation off the field, he has always been well loved by his teammates through his major league career. He showed his new team why when he made the selfless gesture towards Peterson.

        He has since revealed that he didn't know that he could have become the first player to go five for five in the World Series but added that he didn't care.
        亚利桑那州 Diamondbacks 的击球手 Tommy Pham 在周日的 NLCS 第 5 场比赛之前说，当时他由经理 Torey Lovullo 替补。

        这位外野手正在与草皮脚趾作斗争，并解释说他的经理认为他无法完成他的工作。然而，在休息了一场比赛后，范回到了阵容中，并在第 6 场比赛中做出了令人印象深刻的转变。

        随着世界大赛现在与德克萨斯游骑兵队1-1战平，钻石背队将在接下来的三场比赛中充分利用凤凰城的主场优势。
